Architecture summary:
backend uses a clean, layered architecture: HTTP requests hit Controllers, which call Services for business 
logic, which in turn use Repository classes and SQL queries to talk to PostgreSQL, returning shaped DTO
objects built from Models.Configuration is centralized (Configuration folder and appsettings) so 
infrastructure details are decoupled from domain logic, making the system easier to maintain, 
test, and extend with new features.
